# Healthcare-Analytics-Dashboard-
Built a Power BI dashboard to uncover insights into patient care efficiency, satisfaction, and healthcare service demand.  

Objective:
The objective of this project was to develop an interactive Healthcare Analytics Dashboard that provides insights into patient care efficiency, service demand, and satisfaction levels. The dashboard enables healthcare administrators to identify operational bottlenecks, improve patient experience, and make data-driven decisions to optimise service delivery.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies:

Power BI Desktop

Power Query for Data Cleaning & ETL

DAX for Metrics & Calculations

Star Schema Data Modelling

Healthcare Data Analytics

Step-by-Step Process

1️⃣ Data Import & Cleaning

Imported healthcare operational datasets containing patient demographics, appointment details, wait times, satisfaction scores, and visit frequency.

Cleaned and transformed the data by:

Fixing inconsistent date formats

Removing invalid or missing entries

Categorising appointment types (administrative, non-administrative, emergency, referral, walk-in)

Ensuring data integrity for analysis

2️⃣ Data Modelling & DAX Development

Designed an optimised data model separating fact tables (appointments, visits) from dimension tables (patient, date, appointment type).

Built key DAX measures such as:

Average Wait Time

Monthly Visit Count

Satisfaction Score Average

Referral vs. Walk-in Ratios

Appointment Efficiency KPIs

Ensured fast performance through relationship optimisation and column reduction.

3️⃣ Dashboard Design & Visualization

Developed an intuitive, user-friendly dashboard composed of multiple analytical sections:

Patient Experience Overview:

Visualised satisfaction ratings across age groups, visit types, and facilities.

Integrated KPIs that indicate patient engagement and service quality.

 Wait Time Analysis:

Analysed wait times by service type, day of the week, and provider.

Identified peak hours with higher delays using line and bar charts.

Appointment Trends:

Monthly and quarterly visit trends to track service demand.

Comparison of referrals vs. walk-ins to evaluate patient flow and service distribution.

Service Demand Segmentation:

Visualised administrative vs. non-administrative appointments.

Highlighted patterns in recurring visits and appointment cancellations.

4️⃣ User Experience & Reporting Enhancements

Added interactive slicers for facility, appointment type, department, and time period.

Implemented dynamic tooltips and drill-through pages for provider-level analysis.

Enabled scheduled refresh to support ongoing monitoring of patient service patterns.

📈 Key Results & Impact:

Revealed critical factors contributing to long wait times, enabling targeted action plans.

Improved patient satisfaction by identifying service gaps and high-performing departments.

Supported administrators in optimising appointment scheduling and staffing decisions.

Led to more efficient handling of administrative vs. non-administrative cases, reducing operational bottlenecks.

Empowered healthcare teams with a unified, data-driven view of patient care delivery.
